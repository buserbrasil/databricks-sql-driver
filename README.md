# :warning: DEPRECATED - Metabase Driver: Databricks SQL Warehouse

This project has been discontinued as Metabase has released an official Databricks driver. Please refer to the [official Metabase documentation](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/18e423c8df60e7f108c18eb31c50ca9f64354c6b/docs/databases/connections/databricks.md?plain=1#L2) for connecting to Databricks SQL Warehouse.

We recommend using the official Metabase driver for all Databricks SQL connections going forward.
